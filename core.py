Accompanied by a guide you arrived at a huge pair of stone doors, the entrance to an ancient Incan civilisation. You climbed to the top of the doors and found a hidden switch that opens the doors. A pack of ferocious wolves suddenly attacked you from inside the cave. You leaped to the ground, killing the wolves in a barrage of pistol fire. However, you are too late, and your guide is dead in the snow. Alone, you headed into the caves in search for the village Vilcabamba.",
